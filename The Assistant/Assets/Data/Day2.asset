  - Morning. Terrible sleep. Need coffee. Can you check if I have any urgent emails?
    And see if I can reschedule that lunch with the art team today? Not feeling it.

  endOfDayDialogue:
  - That call with the programmer went better than expected. Thanks for pulling those
    reference images for me right before. And good call on keeping that lunch meeting
    - Sarah had some useful insights for the character designs. Maybe this assistant
    thing isn't just another tech gimmick after all.
