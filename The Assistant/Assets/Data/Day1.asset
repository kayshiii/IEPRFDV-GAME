  - "Did it work? Are you here? Finally. Damn thing took hours to set up. Didn\u2019t
    even have clear instructions for god's sake. Whatever, it works now. Told me
    to get the latest version but it costs a fortune. You\u2019re probably all the
    same anyway. Just some lines of code. But let's see if you're worth what I paid."
  - Open my email, and respond to all of them accordingly. You already know my basic
    information so it should be easy for you yeah?
  endOfDayDialogue:
  - 'Well, that wasn''t terrible. At least I didn''t miss my dentist appointment
    this time. Those reminder notifications actually helped. Let''s try this again
    tomorrow, I guess. '
